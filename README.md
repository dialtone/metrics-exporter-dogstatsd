# metrics-exporter-dogstatsd

__metrics-exporter-dogstatsd__ is a `metrics`-compatible exporter that
aggregates metrics and pushes them to a statsd/dogstatsd agent.

A good chunk of this code is taken from the [Prometheus exporter](https://github.com/metrics-rs/metrics/tree/main/metrics-exporter-prometheus) with some important changes in behavior.
