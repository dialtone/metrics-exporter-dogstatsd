This project is meant to integrate with
[Metrics](https://github.com/metrics-rs/metrics) to export data into a
[statsd](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/measure-anything-measure-everything/)
daemon or service. This crate supports
[dogstatsd](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/datagram_shell/?tabs=metrics).

A vast majority of this code is taken from the
[Prometheus exporter](https://github.com/metrics-rs/metrics/tree/main/metrics-exporter-prometheus).
